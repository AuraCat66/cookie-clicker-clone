# Cookie Cloner

It's just a silly little game with no big ambitions, written in pure HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks or libraries (at least for now).

Click [here](https://auracat66.github.io/cookie-cloner/) to play the game!

## Why?

I wanted to learn some HTML/CSS as well as learning some front-end JavaScript.

For real don't take all of this too seriously please xd.

## How to play

The game autosaves every 3 seconds on the localStorage.

(Todo: Add a way to reset the game?)

Click on the "clone" button to clone a cookie.

Only one for now as the technology for cloning is still very experimental. :pensive: 

*Note: Currently, the lab gives you 100 cookies to start up (this might change in the future).*

When you attain the 10 cookies milestone, you unlock the shop as well as the possibility to buy "autocloners".

The base price for an autocloner is 100 cookies, but the price multiplies by 1.1 every time you buy one.

And... that's it, for now.
